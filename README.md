# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my collection of solutions for problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). This repository serves as a personal record of my progress and a resource for others interested in various problem-solving approaches.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by difficulty levels:

- `/easy/` – Solutions to "Easy" problems
- `/medium/` – Solutions to "Medium" problems
- `/hard/` – Solutions to "Hard" problems

Each subdirectory contains:

- `*.sln` (or the appropriate file extension for the programming language used): The code implementation of the solution.
- `README.md`: A brief description of the problem, the approach taken, and any insights or complexities encountered.

## How to Use

Feel free to browse through the directories to explore solutions to various LeetCode problems. Each `README.md` provides an explanation of the problem and the thought process behind the solution.

If you have suggestions for improvements or alternative approaches, I welcome your contributions. Please open an issue or submit a pull request with your ideas.
